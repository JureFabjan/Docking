# Docking

## Description
Collection of tools for docking and some extras.
The tool requires CCDC python API. Parts work with Schr√∂dinger python API or are written in MOE SVL, though not having those will not make the package unusable.

## Project setup
First create the python package by running the command:
```
python -m build
```

Then move to `dist` subfolder and run:
```
pip install docking-0.0.2-py3-none-any.whl
```

Package requirements:
- bipython
- numpy
- pandas
- ccdc
- MOE for using the included SVL scripts
- optionally schrodinger
